    "#### Introduction\n",
    "It is almost intuitive to believe there is some form of significance to startups of being located near a university. The location of a startup is one of the most important endogenous factors that businesses consider, and this paper seeks to determine the relationship between proximity to top-tier universities and start-up investment success. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many studies have been done focusing on a particular relationship between universities and startups (or innovation), for example, determining the role universities specialized in technical fields, say engineering and applied science (Bonaccorsi et al., 2013), have on startup creation or start-up operations in general (Fritsch & Aamoucke, 2017). Other studies show positive spillovers between research universities and innovation by providing research and development (R&D) initiatives (Anselin et al., 1997). Additionally, some papers show an opposing correlation to fields of study that may have been seen to be the more attractive (Audretsch et al., 2005). Further studies also look at the role of access to knowledge bases in determining the type of startups that are created in the area (Baptista et al., 2010). \n",
    "\n",
    "To research this question, we will use a startup investments data set, which contains information on start-ups from 1980 to 2014, and United States (US) university data, which includes ranking, population, founding year and other information about universities. The focus of this paper is to look at the US. Thus, we will consider universities and startups in the US. With this data we will explore the relationship between proximity and investment success. With the insights gained from this paper, startups may be able to make more informed decisions in the early stages of their life span."

    "The chosen Y variable is investment success- expressed in values such as the average funding rounds, the value of investment raised, and the number of milestones achieved. With our current data set, these are convenient and easy to calculate-investment success measures. They are also relatively easy to interpret for example, higher average funding rounds can be indicative of increased investor-investee interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the x values, we will consider the number of startups per state, the proximity to elite universities, entity type (company, person…), the category of the startup, the city (industry hot-spot), and the number of high-ranking universities in the city. The number of startups per state tells us the density of startups between states, and studying this x variable may help us discover whether or not the concentration of startups is helpful or detrimental to the average funds that each startup receives. \n",
    "The city (industry hot-spot) variable helps us analyze and account for skewed data for example California as a technology hot spot may suggest companies that are in similar or related fields that are located there may benefit from better-skilled workers, and possibly better funding. This is closely related to the next x variable; the category of the startup. There may be disparities between categories of entities and this may influence investment success. The number of high-ranking universities in the city is a necessary variable as it alerts us as to whether or not we can directly answer the research question for those US cities as the research question is focused on top-tier universities."

The scatter plot showed that being located in high-density startup locations provides room for higher average funding rounds than being in a low-density startup location. Further analysis is needed to look fully at the role of proximity to elite universities."
